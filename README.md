# District Service Limit Mod 3.0

-continued and updated for C:S 1.9 (green cities) by TheDogKSP-


## Overview

Allows restricting service building (fire, police, health care, taxi) to selectable districts.
All buildings not within districts will continue to always serve the whole city.

## Technical notes

This mod is implemented in C# using the Colossal Order API and replaces the AI of some game objects. As a result, it's very likely to conflict with other mods that have a similar approach to function.

## Special thanks

SamsamTS, for sharing such a nice UI controls to be used in the mod.
gsteigert, for the orignal mod.
